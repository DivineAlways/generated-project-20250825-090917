# Project Overview

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an overview of the "God, Consciousness, and AI" interactive explorer project. The primary goal is to transform a dense academic essay into an engaging and accessible web experience. The application allows users to navigate through the essay's core themes and sections in a non-linear, interactive format.

## 2. Project Purpose

The key objectives of this project are:

- To create a clear and intuitive user interface for a complex subject matter.
- To structure the essay's content into a logical, data-driven format (JSON).
- To build a fully functional, self-contained prototype using only vanilla web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- To provide comprehensive project artifacts, including documentation and wireframes, that outline the design and development process.

## 3. Key Features

- **Main Dashboard:** Displays the primary sections of the essay as interactive cards.
- **Detail View:** Allows users to click on a section to read its full, detailed content, including sub-sections.
- **Responsive Layout:** The interface adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on all devices.
- **Data-Driven Content:** All text content is loaded dynamically from a JSON file, making it easy to manage and update.
